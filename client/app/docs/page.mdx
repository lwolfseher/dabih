## General Concepts

### Encryption

- During file upload the dataset is processed in memory and not written to disk.
- When the upload starts the server generates a cryptographically strong pseudorandom AES-256-CBC Key (24 Bytes)
- The client creates “chunks”, sequential byte buffers of the data, each with size 2 MiB
- For each chunk we again generate a cryptographically strong pseudorandom initialisation vector (iv)
- The raw chunk data is hashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted using the AES key with the initialisation vector
- We then create a crc32 checksum of the encrypted chunk.
- This encrypted chunk is then written to the file system and the iv, hash and checksum written to the database.

- All the asymmetric keys are RSA Keypairs, with at least 4096 bits.
- We use RSA with Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP).
- To prevent key exchange attacks all keys are fingerprinted using a SHA-256 hash.
